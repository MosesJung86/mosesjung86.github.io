  <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
  <h3>Variable Scope</h3>
  <h4>July 23, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.  It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. One of the very useful tools for Ruby are variables.  Variables are the memory locations which hold any data to be used by any program. There are 5 main variable scopes in Ruby and they all have different ways of declaring them with different functions.  Ruby also has 2 pseudo-variables which cannot be assigned any values.  These are nil and self; nil is assigned to unintialized variables and self refers to the current executing object.
    </p>
    <p>The 5 main variable scopes for Ruby are global, instance, local, class, and constant.  Global variables are declared with a prefixed '$' sign and are accessible from anywhere in the Ruby program regardless of where they are declared.  The use of global variables is strongly discouraged for the reason that it is not visible anywhere in the code for a program and they can also be changed from anywhere in the application, which makes it hard to track bugs. Class variables are declared with a prefix of '@@' and are shared amongst all instance in a class. After a class variable is declared inside the class, that variable value only exists for all objects in that class.  Instance variables are similar to class variables except that they are declared with 1 '@' sign and their values are local to specific instances of an object.  Constant variables are declared by beginning with an uppercase letter and their values that should not be changed once it is assigned a value.  Constant variables that are defined within a class or module and can be accessed from within that class or module, and those defined outside a class or module can be accessed globally.
    </p>
    <p>All 5 variables are all different in their ways of usefulness and the way to call upon them. I would use Global variables if I knew that I would call upon them from many different places.  I would use the Class and Instance variables if I knew that I would use that variable throughout the class.  And I would use Constant variables if I knew that I wanted them to stay constant and do not want it to change.
