  <h2>What is Version Control?</h2>

  <h4>June 14, 2015</h4>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Version control is beneficial in many ways. It is basically a system restore/time machine for your work that also keeps track of what you change and when you changed it.  It is useful for just about anything for anybody.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Git helps keep track of changes with commits which are like 'save points' of your work.  It will save any changes made.  You can look through any of your commits at any time and see all the changes you've made step by step.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Github is literally a hub for Git repositories.  Not only that, but you can use Github to visit and compare changes with other user accounts.  You can use Github for as many changes as you want.  Github will save all your commit changes and you can navigate through them easily.
