  <h3>Creating and Calling upon a Class</h3>
  <h4>July 18, 2015</h4>

<section>
  <p>This is an example of creating your own class, along with its instance variables and instance methods.  This class takes an input of an array and outputs a random generated element from that array (think of it as rolling a dice with words and/or symbols as its sides):</p>
  <section id="ruby">
    <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p>class Dice</p>
    <section id="comment">#This is how to create a class named "Dice"</section>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp def initialize (input)</p>
    <section id="comment">#First we need to initialize the class by setting up input variables</section>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp @input = input</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp @count = input.count - 1</p>
    <section id="comment">#These are instance variables, they are set inside initialize, cannot be modified but can be used anywhere in this class.  To use this instance variable in any of the future methods, we would use the '@' symbol followed by the variable name.</section>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp if sides < 1</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp raise ArgumentError.new("Number cannot be less than 1")</p>
    <section id="comment">#This is to create an Argument Error if the input is less than 1, because you cannot have a dice with less than 1 side</section>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp end</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp def sides</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return @count + 1</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp end</p>
    <section id="comment">#This is an instance method, it is defined inside the class and can be called upon only through the class.  In this method, it is returning how many sides the dice has.</section>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp def roll</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp num = Random.new</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp index = num.rand(0..@count)
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return @input.fetch(index.to_i)</p>
    <section id="comment">#This is also another instance method, and this method produces a random generated output of an element from that array input.  Notice how we use '@input' to call upon the instance variable set for the input.</section>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp end</p>
    <p>end</p>
    <p>array = ["Hi",2,"stuff",4,true,"things",6,false]</p>
    <section id="comment">#Now to call upon the class we need to create an object of that class like so:</section>
    <p>d = Dice.new(array)</p>
    <section id="comment">#Then we can call on any method inside the class like this:</section>
    <p>puts d.sides</p>
    <p>puts d.roll</p>
  <p><br /><br /></p>
  </section>
    <p>Creating your own class is useful in many ways.  Instead of having to call a variety of methods constantly, you can just create a class with a set of methods and just call upon the class methods.  If done correctly, it should save time and coding space.  It is also useful if you end up having many different classes so that each method inside the classes may have the same name but may work differently. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This is the class above but without the comments just to show you how it would normally look like:</p>
    <section id="ruby">
    <p>&nbsp</p>
    <p>class Dice</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp def initialize (input)</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp @input = input</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp @count = input.count - 1</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp if sides < 1</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp raise ArgumentError.new("Number cannot be less than 1")</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp end</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp def sides</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return @count + 1</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp end</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp def roll</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp num = Random.new</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp index = num.rand(0..@count)
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp return @input.fetch(index.to_i)</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp end</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp end</p>
    <p>end</p>
    <p>array = ["Hi",2,"stuff",4,true,"things",6,false]</p>
    <p>d = Dice.new(array)</p>
    <p>puts d.sides</p>
    <p>puts d.roll</p>
