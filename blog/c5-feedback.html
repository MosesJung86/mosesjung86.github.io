    <p>It is a very interesting experience to pair with others to solve challenges.  It helps to have an extra opinion and mind working on the same problems. It is very interactive and most of the pairing sessions were very hands on. It is fun to get an idea of how it will be working with lots of other people on the same project.  It is very rewarding at the end when we finally find a solution to one or more problems we have and finally get the program to work.  The only frustrating part is when your partner is behind on material or does not really understand and know what the challenge is about or have any idea how to do it.  The difficult part about that is having to pick up the slack and do the work yourself.  It is like the same thing as doing the challenge yourself.

    <p>The feedback that I have received really gave me insight to some of my weaker social aspects.  It really cued me in to what I should try to improve on.  The first couple feedbacks helped me improve on my future pairing sessions.  Based on the feedback I received, I really need to work on speaking my mind and opinion more concise and clearly.  I also need to be patient and should not rush too fast over the challenge.  I should also explain and help my pair understand what I doing at all times.
    </p>
    <p>It was a little difficult to write feedback in the beginning because I did not really know what to write but after reading a couple feedbacks left from other people, I had somewhat of an idea of how to leave good feedback.  It is the most difficult thing to write feedback for my pair that sounds a little harsh or insulting but I guess it is for my pair to improve.  Overall, I think pairing and leaving feedback is a good guide to improve each other's weaknesses and a better way to communicate with each other.
