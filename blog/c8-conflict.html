  <h2>Conflict</h2>
  <h3>How I dealt with it</h3>
  <h4>Aug 6, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Once upon a time, I had an argument with a relative about a subject that is irrelevant.  We both stated our opinions about this subject but he told me that my opinion was wrong and that his was right.  I told him that opinions are not facts and cannot be true or false.  He told me that my opinion was a fact and that it was false.  For example, I said that red was a nice color, and he said that red is not a nice color.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The source of this conflict occurred when my relative told me that my opinion was a fact and that it was false.  At the time, I felt annoyed and disregarded.  Upon analyzing the conflict, I calmed myself down knowing that not everybody had the right way of thinking especially during confrontations.  These conflicts happen pretty often and I have learned to just ignore whatever the other person is saying due to it not "making any sense".  If I could go back to the first experience, I would change myself from getting mad to simply ignoring it in the beginning and not let it bother me because there is no way to prove whose argument is right or wrong.  I learned from this experience that not everybody has common sense when it comes to opinions and truth.
