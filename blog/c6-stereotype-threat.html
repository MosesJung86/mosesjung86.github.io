  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>

  <section>
    <p>Stereotype threat is a situation where people feel at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one's social group.  Stereotype threat has been shown to reduce the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups.  If negative stereotypes are present regarding a specific group, the group members are likely to become anxious about their performance, whih may hinder their ability to perform at their maximum level. There were a couple times in my life where I have faced stereotype threats whether it was at school, work or just in social situations.  One of the more embarassing moments was in my economics class in college where my professor was talking about a study of how different races needed more cash income to get with a "white" woman.  She then showed a graph of how much different races needed to make with asian being at the bottom and needed the most income out of any other race to get with this type of woman.  She then told the class that it might offend some people and then decided to look straight at me for awhile as people around the class started to look towards me.  As it did not offend me as much as it embarassed me, it really got me thinking into stereotypes and how it can really affect different people of all different races.  At the time I really did not think about how my income can affect relationships with different races but after that session in class, I always kept in the back of my head that it would be harder to get with a different type of race, statistically speaking. It really opened my eyes to how stereotypes can really affect people in a negative way and how it can also affect results just from the notion of a negative stereotype.

    <p>Another example I faced with constantly are the stereotypes of asian people not being proficient drivers or not being able to see correctly because of our "slanted" eyes.  I know a lot of people who say and think that if somebody is horrible behind the wheel of a car that it is "probably because that person is asian" or told to "open my eyes".  This threat has always resulted in me trying to prove my worth in driving proficiently and seeing things accurately in efforts of gaining any trust in these aspects and many more.  This threat has also got me to tell my fellow asian drivers not to drive wrecklessly in fear of increasing the belief of that same stereotype.  I have also seen teachers yell at me and my friends in class for falling asleep merely because he thought our eyes were closed.  In his defense, it did seem like a coincidental accident but it did get the class hysterically laughing at this stereotype of how our eyes can seemed closed.

    <p>Most of the time, I can brush off a lot of these stereotypes because I know that they are not true but there are some times where it does slightly offend me or change my behavior a little bit not to further that stereotype.  There are many stereotypes about all different races, and whether they are true or not, I feel like it really shouldn't affect anybody as much as they do.  A lot of stereotypes are made up everyday and are used in a joking manner but overall sometimes they do offend and can hurt peoples feelings if they're sensitive to the subject.  I would advise not really listening to these stereotypes that people say or having these stereotypes really affect you because there is no real way to change their opinions if they really believe these stereotypes and it is not up to you to change their belief.  I would also advise not to aid in spreading the stereotypes around to anybody because it does not help anybody in the long run.
