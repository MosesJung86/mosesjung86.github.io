  <h2>Good Questions</h2>
  <h3></h3>
  <h4>Aug 12,2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What makes a good question? A good question provides details that can be answered by someone who can solve that problem.  It also provides good spelling, grammar and punctuation.  In my earlier job of fixing computers, providing even the minor details can help solve software and hardware problems.  It is good to provide as many details as needed but providing too much detail may confuse the other person.  It is also important to get straight to the point in the question.  Dragging along the question may bore or confuse the reader.  A lot of unanswered questions are due to being very vague or confusing to a lot of viewers.  It is important to be considerate of the readers point and not confuse them.
