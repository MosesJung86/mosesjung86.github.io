    <p>I chose creativity because of a lot of details in my life.  Whether it is school, work or social situations, I have noticed that I have an extraordinary creative mind and a unique imagination.  I have noticed in doing school projects and groupwork, I always came up with efficient and smart ways to finish the work.  Even in all my jobs, I always found creative ways to complete and organize all my tasks.  I have been complimented by a lot of my teachers and my bosses for having an incredible mind by finding a simple solution for a lot of my work.
    </p>
    <p>The last topic someone asked me for help was the situation with money management.  They needed help in how to save money and how to use it properly within their budget.  I helped them lower spending and hinted to put away some of the money a month at a time.  They told me that it was very wise and effective.  I seem to have a lot of friends ask me on strategic advice on a lot of things in life and I am always there to help them in need.
    </p>
    <p>When I think about my values, I know that they help me evaluate my life and my character.  I try to be aware of any bad habits and always try and develop a better relationship with anybody around me.  The values that I chose are some of the things that I have always known and also have been complimented on.
