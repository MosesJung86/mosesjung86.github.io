  <h3>The Inflection Point</h3>
  <h4>July 12, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>Since technology is constantly being upgraded and new technology seems to be invented at such a fast pace, it is a constant learning experience for anybody in this field.  Technology that came out not too long ago are already being outdated and new technology is constantly being invented and made more efficient.  It is very concerning to update the knowledge and skills for any technology staff and also hard to optimize and utilize the use of technology in teaching, learning and understanding the new technology that is released.
    </p>
    <p>The inflection point is used to describe a turning point that results in extraordinary change.  Perhaps the most vivid illustration of this power of extraordinary growth is Ray Kurzweil's concept of the second half of the chessboard. This concept is based on a legend about the invention of chess. When the emperor asked the creator of chess to name his reward for having invented the game, the inventor requested that for the first square of the board, he would receive one grain of wheat, two for the second square, four for the third square, and so forth, doubling the amount for each square. Kurzweil noted that although such an exponential growth pattern accrues only modest quantities at the beginning, when the second half of the chessboard is reached, the ensuing increases produce almost unimaginably large amounts.  Viewing the impact from this perspective, we can see that technology will at some point reach the second half of the chessboard.  Some people think that this has already happened and call it the "second machine age": "Computers and other digital advances are doing for mental power—the ability to use our brains to understand and shape our environments—what the steam engine and its descendants did for muscle power." Analytics, cloud, mobile devices, social media, and online education might all be viewed as the fruits of the second machine age. IT architecture, process optimization, service management, and risk management are efforts to manage this overwhelming bounty.
    </p>
    <p>The second half of the chessboard is one reason for the inflection point we have reached. A second is related to the technology adoption curve. Individuals and institutions adopt technology at different rates: a few are on the bleeding edge, a few are the last to change, and most fall somewhere in the comfortable middle of the bell curve of adoption. The higher education community is no exception. An inflection point in adoption is reached when mainstream adopters cross that chasm and begin to enter a marketplace. As Moore describes it, they are motivated not by the desire to innovate (which motivates early adopters) but by the need to solve a problem that their current solutions cannot address, a need that activates an otherwise cautious group. When solutions become available that address their particular problems, members of that group will adopt new technologies.
