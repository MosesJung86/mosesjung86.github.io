  <h2>Abstract Sequential</h2>
  <h3>A linear mind that is not always what it seems</h3>

    <p>An abstract sequential thinking style is a type of mindset that likes to analyze situations before making a decision or acting on it.  They like to apply logic in solving and finding solutions to problems.  I believe that I have had this type of thinking style ever since I was little and have been applying it to almost everything in my life.  I first realized this thinking style on the first day of motorcycle school when they taught me the SEE formula.  SEE stands for Search, Evaluate, and Execute.  They taught me to search for all possible dangers, evaluate and assess the dangers, and have a plan for execution in the case that the danger does happen.  I realized that this type of thinking was not only useful for riding a motorcycle but also for a lot of things in life.  I like to look for possible problems, assess the probability and/or risk of the problem and execute according the best plan.

    <p>Abstract Sequential thinking styles learn best when they have access to experts or references, placed in stimulating environments, and able to work alone.  The hardest for Abstract Sequential thinkers are when they are being forced to work with those of differing views, or if they have too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly.  They also have a hard time if they are repeating the same tasks over and over or have a lot of specific rules and regulations.  They also like to express their emotions and are pretty diplomatic when convincing others.  I do think that working alone is best, especially if others have differing views.  Although, I do like to ask experts or to look up things when I do not know the answer.  The idea of tedious tasks or things with a lot of specific rules and regulations is not something I enjoy or would like to learn in, although I have learned things in those environments in the past.  The best way for me to learn is being able to study the material and then test it out hands on.

    <p>The idea of a growth mindset vs. a fixed mindset is an interesting topic.  A fixed mindset assumes that our character, intelligence and creative ability are stuck in the place that it is in while a growth mindset, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as room for improvement and growth.  Both of these mindsets manifest at a very early age and influences a great deal on our behavior and our relationships with success and failures in both the professional and personal worlds.  I always think that my mind is capable of growing and learning new things as I grow older.  I believe that it is possible to plateau in some fields but in most cases, I feel like you can always improve and grow your mind and the way of thinking.
