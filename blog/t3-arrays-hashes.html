  <h2>Arrays vs. Hashes</h2>
  <h3>The benefits and differences</h3>
  <h4>June 28, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>   What are the benefits and differences between Arrays and Hashes?  An Array is an ordered, integer-indexes collection of any object while a Hash is a dictionary-like collection that uses any object type as its index.  The uses differ to what the user really is trying to accomplish and what they are comfortable with.
    </p>
    <p>   Arrays indexing starts at 0 and can also have negative indexes which start backwards from the end of the Array.  An index of -1 would indicate the last element of an Array.  An Array can contain many different types of objects ranging from all sorts of numbers and characters, including Strings, Integers, Fixnums, Hashes, Symbols, and even other Array objects. An array is useful for organizing, searching, accessing, and manipulating objects and they grow automatically while adding elements to them.  Arrays are created using brackets [ ] and their values are separated by a comma.  An example of what an Array looks like: <br /><section id="ruby"><br />To_do_list = [school, work, play, sleep]<br /><br /></section>
    </p>
    <p>   Hashes, on the other hand, is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their value.  Hashes are very similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash uses any object type.  Hashes index everything not by the order it was made but by the corresponding keys that were inserted.  So in example, even if you make a Hash with a key value of A after a Hash with a key value of B, it would print out the key value of A then B when called upon the Hash.  An example of what a Hash looks like: <br /><section id="ruby"><br />Hash = {"Sports" => "Basketball", "Food" => "Pizza"}<br /><br /></section>
    </p>
    <p>   The real benefits between Arrays and Hashes are when to use each one.  Arrays would be useful when creating lists of things in the order that you created them and that will keep order when you add to the array.  You can also remove the numbered value as well as the array slot so that all the other array slots move down their numbered value.  A good example of an Array would be a numbered "To-do-list" that can get crossed out once completed.  The benefit of a Hash is for creating lists associated with other words for you to keep in order and remember.  The best example I can think of is assigning different keys (indexes) like food, sports, and tv and then putting different values into them such as apple, pizza and cheesburgers into food; baseball, basketball and football into sports; and ABC, HBO, and MTV into tv.
