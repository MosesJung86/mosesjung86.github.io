      The main difference between an inline and an inline block is that an inline has no space above or below it and an inline block has some space on an element on the same line.  To really know the differences, you have to know what is allowed for both.  Inline elements cannot have a width or height, and although they can have left and right margins and padding, they cannot have a top or bottom margin or padding.  They can, however, have elements sit next to them.
      Inline elements are written as "display:inline". Inline-block elements are just like inline elements except that inline-block elements can have a width and height assigned to it.  It can also have top and bottom margins and padding.  Inline-block elements are written as "display:inline-block".  Inline-block elements basically have a block shape to it and are given space next to each other while inline elements can overlap each other.
