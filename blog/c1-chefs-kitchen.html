      I can't wait for the DBC Experience!  It sounds like its going to be an awesome experience with lots of friendly interactive people.  I am stoked to get to know everybody.  My impression of DBC is that it is a very hands-on interactive learning environment that will provide emotional support as well as guiding through tough challenges.

My impression of DBC has not changed and I see myself doing really well in this type of culture.  I am really excited to participate in this learning environment and I hope I can benefit this school a lot more than they would expect. I am nervous because it would be the first time really being away from home, not having to work but study full time.  I do believe my excitement overwhelms by nervousness though.
