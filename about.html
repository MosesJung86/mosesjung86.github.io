    <p>Hello, my name is Moses Jung and I was born in Los Angeles, California.  I am a Korean American and was born in 1986.  I have lived in Koreatown, CA for the majority of my younger years and I currently reside in Torrance, CA.  I have been taught to be well mannered and have great insight in many different diverse cultures.
    </p>
    <p>The things that I enjoy doing are riding my motorcycle and also playing strategic games.  I also am a huge comic book fan, both Marvel and DC Comics, and a movie fanatic (Some have called me the Movie Guru).  I enjoy playing strategic games such as chess because it really gives me the incentive to use my brain strategically and view the game in depth.
    </p>
    <p>I was always intrigued by computers and technology ever since I built my very own computer when I was 15.  I initially majored in Business Administration out of high school but after 2 years, I realized that it was computer programming that I was meant to pursue.  Using the knowledge of the computer and technology world, I majored in computer science, learned C++, and started to understand how programs function and interact.
    </p>
    <p>I feel like I apply the strategy of chess to almost everything in my life.  The strategy of seeing all possible risks, assuming all possible outcomes, and executing the best judgement for result.  I've applied this strategy to riding my motorcycle as well, and it has been proven very beneficial.  Assuming that every obstacle is trying to hit you at the same time, it gives you a plan and prepares your reflexes to follow through according to the plan if an obstacle does decide to try and take you out.  In my opinion and experience, I have noticed that the best strategy is the one that is well planned out and have taken every possible risk and outcome into consideration.
    </p>
